# Handover: start here

Faro is an internal goals (OKR) app for a 15,000-person company, built to be easy for another AI to understand and rebuild. This page is the starting point for a new session. Read it, then `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/backlog.md`.

## Where things are

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Live app | https://goals-app-puce-five.vercel.app (demo at `/demo`) |
| Preview of the `journeys` branch | https://goals-app-git-journeys-lanehirschfield-5825s-projects.vercel.app |
| Design plan (Claude Docs) | https://claude.ai/artifact/6XPyzprnhTVsBSziB4GVwP |
| Repo | github.com/sconies/goals-app, working branch `journeys` |
| Database | Supabase project `wlbetxkmrvwqfxvxntzl` (shared with another app's tables; leave those alone). Migrations 0001–0027 applied. CI applies new ones on merge |
| Sign-in links | No longer used by Faro: the inbox is open with no sign-in since backlog O (8 Nov). Supabase, Authentication, URL Configuration. Site URL belongs to the Kerry Lane app (leave it). Redirect URLs list Faro's: `https://goals-app-puce-five.vercel.app/**` and `https://goals-app-*-lanehirschfield-5825s-projects.vercel.app/**` (added 7 Nov) |
| Rules for working here | `CLAUDE.md` |
| What to build next, in order | `docs/backlog.md` |
| What Faro is, generated from the code | `llms.txt` and `spec/` (`npm run spec`; items 8a and 8b) |
| The rebuild kit and its drill | `spec/rebuild/README.md`; the harness is `npm run drill -- <folder>` (item 8k) |
| Handing Faro to the internal team: the checklist | `docs/handoff.md` (hand-written; keep it in step with 8g, 0c, 8c, 11) |

## State on Tuesday 10 November, early morning

- **Everything approved for Wednesday has merged** (see the backlog's Done table, #68–#79): Lane's "Being handled needs an action" rule, Decide in the review, the Map at scale, set-up and check-in honesty, talk-path polish, the small batch (migration 0034), engineer docs (ports at company scale, R6). **Code freeze: Tuesday 14:00 UTC.**
- **The demo is pinned:** present from `/demo?today=2026-11-11`; `docs/demo-script.md` has the numbers read from it on 10 Nov (Rhea 5 check-ins to do, Amara 126 goals and 20 to discuss, Needs attention 41).
- **The "Pet store" workspace was deleted** (Lane, 9 Nov), so the live root shows the welcome page again. Any workspace made on the live site brings the name picker back.
- **Build sessions still block on Send Message prompts** when nobody is watching: all five did on the night of 9 Nov. Read their reports from `list_events` and check their PRs' CI directly; merge main into later branches in the main checkout (a worktree with linked `node_modules` puts absolute paths in `api/mcp.js`).
- **Open after Wednesday:** the backlog's "After Wednesday" line. 0c still waits on Lane creating Faro's Supabase project.

## State on Monday 9 November, night

- **What Faro is for:** a model the company's internal team will copy and adapt, plus demos and an off-site. Never real data. **Lane presents it on Wednesday 11 Nov** (moved from Tuesday) to leaders and engineers, including **building the metric library's screens live** (`docs/live-build/metrics.md`, script `docs/demo-script.md`, dry-run `docs/live-build/checklist.md`).
- **Merged 9 Nov (main, CI green):** live-build kit and rehearsal lessons (#56, #60), 8c swappable parts (#58: `src/ports`, `src/adapters`, a plain-Postgres store, `spec/rebuild/adapters.md`), G phone Goals page (#61), Goals search/URL/history hotfix (#62), goal-page hotfix (#63: plan sanity check, Done goals show their result, "Updated" date), review triage GP/GD/NAV/MAP (#65), R review leftovers (#64: F16 reload after deploy, F03, F07, F08–F10, F13, F14).
- **Live-build rehearsals:** run 1 (answer 3 "with a reason") 21 min to preview, 41 to green CI (#55); **run 2, the fallback** (#57, brief as on stage) 13 min to preview, 16 to green. Neither is merged; never merge them. Previews are behind Vercel sign-in.
- **Building on the night of 9 Nov (each reports once to the planning session; Lane pre-approved "merge any time" when green and reviewed):**
  - **8g** (#59): drill gaps closed; **drill 2 scored 100% (360,109 values) from the kit alone**, no answers read from the scorer. Being brought up to date with main.
  - **GP** (branch `goals-decisions`): Needs attention shows handled goals in a "Being handled" group (Lane), Cards layout cut (Lane), health line, worst-first across trees, Board tweaks, History values; plus Lane's evening asks: "Being handled" explains itself everywhere, and New goal is no longer the Goals page's big button (the sidebar entry stays).
  - **faro-mark** (branch `faro-mark`): the workspace initial top-left becomes Faro's F mark (Lane).
  - **WS** (branch `workspace-rework`, Lane: before Wednesday): Workspace truthfulness bugs, the Inbox moved out of Workspace as a global "Feedback" place (open, never emails), reset admin-only plus Leave, recording asked at set-up, a persistent workspace switcher, "Admin" on badges and a permissions line, a real Overview and Cycles, Home's set-up prompt moved. Review: an outside deep dive of Workspace on 9 Nov (in Lane's chat, summarised in WS's brief).
- **When GP and WS land:** update `docs/demo-script.md` with the changes they list (Needs attention numbers, Inbox location, review walkthrough's "Outstanding" line from R, the first-check-in note), then Lane's dry run on Tuesday evening.
- **After Wednesday, in order:** 0c (own database: free Supabase tier allows 2 active projects and Lane has 2; options are Supabase Pro or plain Postgres via 8c's adapter), 0a, L, GD, NAV, MAP, small batch (0u, 10a, R5), 3a, 0t, 11. Wednesday's feedback may change it.
- **Things to know:**
  - The repo is **public** so CI is free; nothing secret is in it.
  - Health check: `https://goals-app-puce-five.vercel.app/api/mcp?check`.
  - Builds run in the cloud environment **goals-app**. The database has no workspaces, so no AI token works until Lane makes one.
  - **Build sessions block on permission prompts** (Send Message, Send Later) when nobody is watching; several sat for hours on 9 Nov. Their reports can be read from their transcripts (`list_events`, assistant kind). Pre-approving those tools in `.claude/settings.json` is Lane's to do. Tell builds not to use scheduling tools.
  - Lane's Telegram bot (Keel, @Lane_claude_bot, token in the `api.telegram.org.` environment) didn't receive messages through a relay session on 9 Nov; parked.
  - Outside reviews and their triage are in `docs/reviews/`; open points are in the backlog.

## How the planning session should run (lesson of 8 Nov)

- **Keep this session's context small.** Don't subscribe to PR activity or relay CI and bot notices: each build session watches its own PR and reports once, when it's ready or blocked. Read build reports, decide, merge.
- **Merging:** Lane approves each merge (or pre-approves, e.g. "merge when green"). When he pre-approves, merge from here once the build reports green; build sessions won't merge on a relayed approval.
- **Recommend a fresh planning session unprompted** as soon as this one starts to fill up (about half full): update this handover, then give Lane a ready-to-paste prompt (CLAUDE.md, "Fresh planning sessions").

## How we work (Lane, 7 November)

- **Two kinds of session.**
  - **The planning session** takes Lane's ideas, runs grills, keeps the backlog in order and decides merges.
  - **A build session** builds one release, starting from a short brief. Only one build runs at a time in any area.
- **Ideas go to the backlog first.** Build only what Lane picks or has approved as next.
- **Backlog edits** ride with the next feature PR.
- **Be quiet while waiting.** Report merges, failures and decisions; nothing else.
- **Use models to match the work.**
  - **Strongest model:** planning, architecture and review.
  - **Lighter model:** mechanical work.
- **Database changes** apply through CI on merge. Show the full SQL in the PR description.
- **Commits and PRs** follow `CLAUDE.md`:
  - **Author:** Lane.
  - **Committer:** Claude.
  - **Trailers:** the session trailers.
  - **Merging:** merge when CI is green, then post the PR and live links.

## Brief for a build session

> Build backlog item <N> of Faro, as described in `docs/backlog.md`, following `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/design-rules.md`. Base it on `origin/main`, work on branch `journeys`, run the full quality gate, open a draft PR with any SQL in its description, and merge when CI is green. Report back with the PR, the live link, screenshots of what changed, and any decision you had to make.
